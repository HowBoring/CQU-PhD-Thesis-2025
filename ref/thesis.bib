               computationally expensive and are usually handled using
               surrogate-assisted EAs(SAEAs) [1], employing inexpensive
               approximation regression and classification models, such as the
               Gaussian process model [2], radial basis network (RBN), etc., to
               replace the costly fitness evaluation [3]. SAEAs have proven to

  abstract  = {In the literature, cell-based neural architecture search (NAS) has achieved efficient NAS performance by decomposing the general search space and focusing the search on the micro-architecture. Recently, it has attracted much attention and achieved considerable success in the design of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for vision-oriented tasks, such as image recognition, object detection, etc. However, in most heuristic cell-based NAS methods, the joint optimization of normal cells and reduction cells leads to an extremely time-consuming search. Taking this cue, in this paper, we present a preliminary study on investigating the independence between different cells towards efficient cell-based NAS design. Based on the investigation, we further propose a two-stage search paradigm for cell-based NAS, which can be easily integrated into existing heuristic search methods. To validate the efficacy of the proposed approach, an empirical study has been conducted on the CIFAR-10 dataset, using a genetic algorithm as the basic heuristic solver.},
