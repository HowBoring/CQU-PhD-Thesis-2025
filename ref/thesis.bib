               computationally expensive and are usually handled using
               surrogate-assisted EAs(SAEAs) [1], employing inexpensive
               approximation regression and classification models, such as the
               Gaussian process model [2], radial basis network (RBN), etc., to
               replace the costly fitness evaluation [3]. SAEAs have proven to
               be useful and efficient in a variety of practical optimization

  abstract  = {In the literature, cell-based neural architecture search (NAS) has achieved efficient NAS performance by decomposing the general search space and focusing the search on the micro-architecture. Recently, it has attracted much attention and achieved considerable success in the design of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for vision-oriented tasks, such as image recognition, object detection, etc. However, in most heuristic cell-based NAS methods, the joint optimization of normal cells and reduction cells leads to an extremely time-consuming search. Taking this cue, in this paper, we present a preliminary study on investigating the independence between different cells towards efficient cell-based NAS design. Based on the investigation, we further propose a two-stage search paradigm for cell-based NAS, which can be easily integrated into existing heuristic search methods. To validate the efficacy of the proposed approach, an empirical study has been conducted on the CIFAR-10 dataset, using a genetic algorithm as the basic heuristic solver.},

These methods have dramatically improved the state-of-the-art in speech recognition, visual object recognition, object detection and many other domains such as drug discovery and genomics. Deep learning discovers intricate structure in large data sets by using the backpropagation algorithm to indicate how a machine should change its internal parameters that are used to compute the representation in each layer from the representation in the previous layer. Deep convolutional nets have brought about breakthroughs in processing images, video, speech and audio, whereas recurrent nets have shone light on sequential data such as text and speech.},

  abstract  = {The graphics processing unit (GPU) has become an integral part of today's mainstream computing systems. Over the past six years, there has been a marked increase in the performance and capabilities of GPUs. The modern GPU is not only a powerful graphics engine but also a highly parallel programmable processor featuring peak arithmetic and memory bandwidth that substantially outpaces its CPU counterpart. The GPU's rapid increase in both programmability and capability has spawned a research community that has successfully mapped a broad range of computationally demanding, complex problems to the GPU. This effort in general-purpose computing on the GPU, also known as GPU computing, has positioned the GPU as a compelling alternative to traditional microprocessors in high-performance computer systems of the future. We describe the background, hardware, and programming model for GPU computing, summarize the state of the art in tools and techniques, and present four GPU computing successes in game physics and computational biophysics that deliver order-of-magnitude performance gains over optimized CPU applications.},

  year          = {2017},
  month         = oct,
  abstract      = {We present the checkpoint ensembles method that can learn ensemble models on a single training process. Although checkpoint ensembles can be applied to any parametric iterative learning technique, here we focus on neural networks. Neural networks' composable and simple neurons make it possible to capture many individual and interaction effects among features. However, small sample sizes and sampling noise may result in patterns in the training data that are not representative of the true relationship between the features and the outcome. As a solution, regularization during training is often used (e.g. dropout). However, regularization is no panacea -- it does not perfectly address overfitting. Even with methods like dropout, two methodologies are commonly used in practice. First is to utilize a validation set independent to the training set as a way to decide when to stop training. Second is to use ensemble methods to further reduce overfitting and take advantage of local optima (i.e. averaging over the predictions of several models). In this paper, we explore checkpoint ensembles -- a simple technique that combines these two ideas in one training process. Checkpoint ensembles improve performance by averaging the predictions from "checkpoints" of the best models within single training process. We use three real-world data sets -- text, image, and electronic health record data -- using three prediction models: a vanilla neural network, a convolutional neural network, and a long short term memory network to show that checkpoint ensembles outperform existing methods: a method that selects a model by minimum validation score, and two methods that average models by weights. Our results also show that checkpoint ensembles capture a portion of the performance gains that traditional ensembles provide.},
