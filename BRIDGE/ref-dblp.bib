               computationally expensive and are usually handled using
               surrogate-assisted EAs(SAEAs) [1], employing inexpensive
               approximation regression and classification models, such as the
               Gaussian process model [2], radial basis network (RBN), etc., to
               replace the costly fitness evaluation [3]. SAEAs have proven to
               be useful and efficient in a variety of practical optimization
               applications [1].},
