## V. Project Structure and File Management

- **`main.tex`**: This is the root file. It should include all other parts of the thesis.
- **`contents/`**: This directory will hold the `.tex` files for each chapter.
- **`figures/`**: This directory will store all images and plots.
- **`ref/`**: This directory contains the bibliography file `refs.bib`.
- **No modifications to `contents/` directory for now.**

This plan will be executed sequentially. I will start with Chapter 1 and proceed through the document. I will provide updates as I complete major sections.
